# [Project_Pomodoro_Timer](https://dry-dusk-16081.herokuapp.com/ "Pomodoro Timer -- Heroku Deployment")
Pomodoro Timer App developed in React!

Currently passes all required tests, but I do wish to revisit this and punch it up with some additional CSS and media break points.

May also refactor the code logic some to clean up the organizational structure.
